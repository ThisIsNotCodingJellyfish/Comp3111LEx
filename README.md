This is my 114514th lab in Comp3111 - Software Engineering
1. I definitely haven't learnt the way to build a Java project in IntelliJ
2. I successfully set up my second GitHub account to share project source which nobody cares
3. I prefer C++ and don't care about my score deduction from this statement

Here's the screenshot:
